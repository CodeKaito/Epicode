## Course Outline

### Module 1 - Fundamentals of Programming
Learn the fundamentals of computer science and programming by developing your first real web app!
In this module we will learn JavaScript, HTML, and GIT so we can build from scratch
our first web app.
- Understanding the basics
- Setting up your development environment
- Programming fundamentals (variables, conditions, objects, loops...)
- Version Control (GIT)
- Introduction to Javascript
- Javascript + DOM

### Module 2: UX/UI e Front-end development
Learn the fundamentals and principles of UX/UI and delve into the concepts of Front-end development!

- Core concepts and fundamentals
- DOM manipulation and events
- Design Patterns in JS
- ES5
- ES6
- Async Patterns / Parallel executions
- Ajax / Promises

### Module 4: Frontend Frameworks (ReactJS)
The complexity of web applications can grow very quickly. This is why it is done
reliance on frameworks and libraries that allow us to divide the code into atomic elements
(components) making applications more professional and maintainable. For this reason in this
module we will learn to use React, the most established web framework in new projects.
- Introduction to popular frameworks (React)
- Building dynamic and interactive user interfaces
- SPA
- Components
- Routing
- State
- Props

### Module 5: Backend Development
After learning to create professional Front-end applications connected to external services,

- Connecting frontend and backend systems
- ExpressJS
- RESP
- Middlewares
- MongoDB
- Authentication and Authorization
- Cloud
